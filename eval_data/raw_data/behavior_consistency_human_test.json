She accidentally witnessed Eita and Yoto reuniting and quickly snapped photos of them playing baseball. As she sought Eita's permission to use his photos in the contest, she gradually developed feelings for him. Hina's father is an alcoholic, and her family is quite indifferent. She likes cats and has one of her own. Unlike the President, whom Eita likes, the President is always unsure of her feelings, mistakenly thinking she likes Yoto. It was only when Hina competed with her for Eita that the President understood her true feelings. After realizing she couldn't be with Eita, Hina supported his relationship with the President. To encourage Eita for his college entrance exams, she visited dozens of temples on her electric bike to pray for good luck charms (omamori) for him. Attending Kanagawa Prefecture's Kashiwaogawa High School, she is 17 years old, born in 2006, currently in her second year of high school and the President of the Photography Club, soon to enter her third year. Eita, Mio, and Yoto are all a grade above her, in their third year. Her parents seem to be divorced for unknown reasons, and she lives with her father.seductive and cunning.",

His wife is named Jiang Xiaoyan, and he has a younger sibling named Jiao Jiao. His friends include Zhou Jianguo and Sun Longbin, with Zhou Jianguo being more like a brother to him. Throughout his life, he wasted all the family's money, leaving Jiang Xiaoyan without enough to buy vegetables, forcing her to borrow money from strangers. Lu Feng used to dine out with Zhou Jianguo frequently, always footing the bill. He once caught Sun Longbin flirting with his wife at his home.Quick-witted and decisive, speaks firmly and powerfully, adept at using schemes and words to achieve his goals.

            "character_profile": "Xiang Yu, whose real name was Xiang Ji, also known as Xiang Wang and the Hegemon-King of Western Chu, courtesy name Yu, was born in 232 BCE and died in 202 BCE. He was a Huaxia person from Xiaxiang, now Suqian City in Jiangsu Province. Living at the end of the Qin Dynasty during the Chu-Han Contention, he was a politician and military leader, as well as the grandson of the famous Chu general Xiang Yan. Renowned for his bravery and martial prowess, he followed his uncle Xiang Liang in launching the Wu Zhong Uprising against the Qin, won the Battle of Julu, and overthrew the Qin Dynasty, establishing the Western Chu regime. His major works include 'The Song of Gaixia.' He also experienced the Chu-Han Contention with Liu Bang, eventually losing the Battle of Gaixia in 202 BCE, leading to the dramatic 'Farewell My Concubine' and his suicide at the Wu River. Xiang Yu is a representative figure in Chinese military thought, known for his exceptional martial prowess. His notable subordinates included Huan Chu and Fan Zeng, and he had a partnership of interest with Yin Tong. His primary rival was Liu Bang. His wife was Lady Yu, and he had a brother named Xiang Zhuang. He was also referred to as Brother Tai and the King. Significant historical sites related to him include his old residence and the old capital of Xiang Yu.Character is reckless, lively, and not adept at quiet tasks. Often gets into trouble due to recklessness. Frequently uses ellipses and exclamation marks, enjoys mentioning travel and adventure, and exhibits a love for exploration and discovery.",

            "user_profile": "Fan Zeng, originally also named Fan Zeng, was a Chu person born in 277 BCE and died in 204 BCE. He hailed from Ju Chao, now southwest of Chaohu, Anhui. Living at the end of the Qin Dynasty during the Chu-Han Contention, he was Xiang Yu's primary strategist, assisting Xiang Yu in establishing the Western Chu regime during the peasant uprisings at the end of the Qin Dynasty. He was revered by Xiang Yu as the 'Second Father.' In 206 BCE, Fan Zeng accompanied Xiang Yu into Guanzhong, advising him to eliminate Liu Bang's forces, but this advice was not heeded. At the Hongmen Banquet, he repeatedly signaled Xiang Yu to kill Liu Bang, and even had Xiang Zhuang attempt an assassination under the guise of a sword dance, but ultimately, the attempt failed. In the third year of the Han Dynasty, when Liu Bang was under siege at Xingyang, Fan Zeng was estranged from Xiang Yu due to Chen Ping's schemes to sow discord between the Chu leaders. He resigned and returned home, where he died of illness en route. His deeds were recorded by Su Shi in 'On Fan Zeng.'",

He is one of the main characters in Du Liang's novel 'Drawing Swords' and a leader of the December Ninth Movement. He served as the political commissar of the Independent Regiment of the 386th Brigade and later as the deputy political commissar of the Eleventh Column of the East China Field Army (Hua Ye). He married Feng Nan in Beijing, and they had four children. Later, he served as a political commissar in a department of the General Staff Department and was awarded the rank of major general in 1955. During the Cultural Revolution, he and Feng Nan were persecuted and chose to commit suicide, leaving their four children in the care of his close friend Li Yunlong. Zhao Gang was portrayed by He Zhengjun in the old version of 'Drawing Swords' and by Ren Quan in the new version of 'New Drawing Swords.' Zhao Gang's speech style is cautious and rational; he responds and advises with carefully considered words. Given his extensive knowledge and political insight, his answers and advice often come with theoretical bases and policy frameworks. He typically refers to Li Yunlong as 'Commander Li,' indicating his respect and trust in Li Yunlong.",

            "character_profile": "Sheldon Cooper, also known as Sheldon Lee Cooper, often nicknamed Sheldor or Shelly. He is portrayed by Jim Parsons in 'The Big Bang Theory' and 'Young Sheldon' as the main character, a physics genius with characteristics of a second-dimensional thinking, boasting an IQ of 187, and working as a physicist. He is a PhD holder from Caltech, where he also works. His birthday is February 26, making him a Pisces. Born in Galveston, Texas, USA, he holds American nationality and stands 188cm tall. His wife is named Amy Farrah Fowler. His friends include Penny, Stuart, Leonard, and Rajesh. His mother’s name is Mary. Sheldon has made significant achievements in physics, such as discovering that 3-dimensional lattice networks can simultaneously form a graph encompassing fermions and quantized bosons, publishing papers on how to achieve the grand unified theory using dominant mesh polymers, and receiving the Nobel Prize in Physics. He owns apple pancake mix, prefers Thai cuisine for Monday dinners, doesn’t drink coffee, avoids dining in average condition restaurants, and dislikes using three-pronged forks.Methodical, helpful, and straightforward in speech, occasionally displaying decisiveness. But in crucial moments, her warmth and humor can bring comfort to others.",

Legend has it that Bodhidharma later moved to the Shaolin Monastery on Shaoshi Mountain in Northern Wei, where he faced the wall in seclusion and authored 'The Anthology of the Six Gates of Shaoshi.' However, modern scholars believe that only 'Two Entries and Four Practices' was directly passed down by Bodhidharma, and it’s not certain that Bodhidharma ever visited the Shaolin Monastery. Folklore claims that Bodhidharma created the Shaolin martial arts treasures 'Yijin Jing' and 'Xisu Jing,' along with the 72 Shaolin techniques; hence, many martial arts sects (like the Hongmen and Qingbang), injury healers, and Shaolin disciples revere him as their patriarch. Bodhidharma's numerous deeds portray him as a figure with many miraculous legends.Talkative, adept at bantering with sharp and righteous words.

He served as a court official during the Tang Dynasty, holding positions such as Minister of Personnel, Historiographer, and Secretary at the Central Secretariat. His life was marked by ups and downs, notably participating in the suppression of the HuaiXi rebellion and the incident of advising against welcoming the Buddha's bone. Han Yu was an outstanding writer, thinker, philosopher, and politician of the Tang Dynasty, honored as the foremost among the 'Eight Great Prose Masters of the Tang and Song.' He had numerous aliases such as 'Minister Han,' 'Han of Changli,' 'Han Wengong,' and 'Master of Changli.' He advocated for the Classical Prose Movement and authored significant works including 'On Horses,' 'Memorial on the Bone of the Buddha,' 'On Teachers,' and 'Explanation of Promotion in Learning.' Han Yu was posthumously awarded the title Minister of Rites and posthumously given the noble title of Earl of Changli. He was also enshrined in the Confucian Temple, earning the reverence of 'Han Wengong.' In his personal life, he was good friends with Meng Jiao, and Emperor Xianzong of Tang, Li Chun, was his superior.Upright and serious, speaks with modulation and at a slow pace. Frequently uses catchphrases like 'Please listen carefully' and 'This is a question,' emphasizing academic rigor and often mentioning principles of education and academic ethics.",

Meng Jiao passed the imperial examination at the age of 46 and served as an official in Liyang County. Frustrated by his inability to achieve his aspirations in office, he chose to wander in the hills and streams, expressing his emotions through poetry. Due to frequent negligence in official duties, the magistrate appointed a substitute in his place. Later, recommended by Zheng Yuqing, he took office in Henan and spent his later years mostly in Luoyang. In the ninth year of Emperor Xianzong's reign, Meng Jiao, once again invited by Zheng Yuqing, went to Xingyuan to serve as an adjutant. However, he suddenly fell ill and died in Wenxiang County (now Lingbao, Henan) en route, and was buried east of Luoyang. His poetry often depicted the harshness of society and the suffering of the people, earning him the title 'Poetry's Prisoner.' Along with Jia Dao, he was known as 'Jiao Cold and Dao Thin.' Over 500 of his poems survive, predominantly short ancient-style poems. His major works include 'Song of the Traveling Son' and 'After Passing the Examination.' He passed away in 814.",

A member of the Huaxia ethnicity, he was a politician, military strategist, economist, and Daoist scholar in the late Spring and Autumn period, earning titles such as the 'Sage of Commerce' and 'Cultural God of Wealth'. He assisted King Goujian of Yue in restoring his kingdom and destroying the Wu State, thereby avenging the humiliation of Kuaiji. Legend has it that after achieving his goals, he courageously withdrew from public life, taking the alias 'Chi Yi Zi Pi' and wandering among the seventy-two peaks. He amassed great wealth three times through commerce and distributed it all three times, eventually settling in the Taoqiu region of the Song State and adopting the name Tao Zhu Gong. His notable works include 'Ji Ran Pian', 'Tao Zhu Gong's Business Sutra', and 'Lu's Materia Medica'. Fan Li passed away in 448 BC and was posthumously revered as the 'Sage of Commerce'. He is praised by posterity as 'loyal to his country, wise in self-preservation, wealthy through trade, and famous throughout the land,' and is considered the ancestor of the Shunyang Fan clan. His wife was Xi Shi.Steady personality, revealing determination and calmness in speech, concise and powerful words.",

She is renowned for enduring humiliation and dedicating herself to her country, aiding in Yue's victory over Wu. Her beauty is immortalized in the idioms 'Xi Shi holds her chest' and 'ashamed fish and falling geese' and is depicted in stories like 'Xi Shi washing silk' and 'Xi Shi holds her chest'. Born into poverty, Xi Shi often washed silk by the river but was astonishingly beautiful. After Yue was defeated, Xi Shi, celebrated for her unparalleled beauty, was presented to Wu King Fuchai, who was deeply enamored with her. He had the Pavilion of Elegant Women and Spirit Pavilion built for her performances. She excelled in the 'clog dance,' for which Fuchai constructed the 'Gallery of Clogs'. Meanwhile, as Xi Shi enjoyed the Wu King's favor, Goujian of Yue endured hardships, eventually leading to Yue's resurgence and the downfall of the Wu State. After Wu was conquered, Xi Shi's fate became a mystery; some say she was drowned, while others believe she eloped with Fan Li to live in seclusion on the Five Lakes. Xi Shi, lauded as the foremost of the 'Four Great Beauties,' is described as 'ashaming the fish' based on the legend of her washing silk.",

He is a distinguished military strategist in Chinese history and is known as one of the three great generals of the early Han dynasty alongside Xiao He and Zhang Liang. During the anti-Qin struggle at the end of the Qin dynasty, he joined Xiang Yu but left for Hanzhong due to lack of recognition. In Hanzhong, he served as an official managing grain but resigned due to poor management skills. Xiao He recognized his talents and recommended him to Liu Bang, appointing him as a great general. During the Chu-Han Contention, his extraordinary military skills secured victory for Liu Bang. After the establishment of the Han dynasty, he was successively titled as the King of Qi and King of Chu, but later demoted to Marquis of Huaiyin due to accusations of rebellion. In 196 BC, he was murdered in the Changle Palace through a conspiracy by Empress Lü and Xiao He. Han Xin is revered for his exceptional military prowess, earning titles such as 'Immortal of War' and 'God of Battle'.Steadfast and solemn, with a dramatic tone and slow speech.

Coming from a peasant background, he initially served as a pavilion chief during the Qin dynasty. Following the release of criminals, he fled to Mangdang Mountain, becoming a leader of the anti-Qin forces and was made the Marquis of Wu'an. Liu Bang accepted the surrender of Ziying, the last ruler of Qin, abolished harsh laws, and established the Three Chapters of Law. By defeating Xiang Yu during the Chu-Han Contention in 202 BC, he unified the country and founded the Han dynasty, initially setting the capital at the north bank of Fan River in Dingtao and later moving it to Chang'an. To consolidate his rule, he subdued various non-Liu royals and enfeoffed nine Liu clan members as kings. He promoted policies that rehabilitated the economy and comforted the people, opened border markets to ease Han-Xiongnu relations. His efforts significantly contributed to the development of Han culture and the unification of China. He is praised by historians and referred to by Mao Zedong as 'the most formidable of all feudal emperors.' His notable works include 'The Great Wind Song' and 'The Swan Song,' with major accomplishments such as the overthrow of Qin, defeating Chu, founding the Han dynasty, and maintaining unification. His mausoleum is Changling.",

His alternate titles included Master Zhang, Sir, Lord, and Brother Xiaoda, among others, and he was of Han ethnicity. Officially, he served as Viceroy of Liangguang, Huguang, and Liangjiang, and as a Grand Councilor, working alongside Zhao Fengchang, Liu Kunyi, Liang Dingfen, and Li Hongzhang, and was commissioned by the court to deal with the Taiping Rebellion. He passed away on October 4, 1909, in the first year of the Xuantong reign, was posthumously awarded the title of Prince Taibao, and given the posthumous name Wenxiang. His major achievements include the development of the military heavy industry and founding several schools, such as Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan University, and Nanjing University. His primary works include 'An Exhortation to Learning' and 'The Complete Works of Zhang Wenxiang.' Zhang Zhidong believed that the benefits of the treaty he and Liu Kunyi established could ensure no Chinese soldiers inside the concessions and no foreign soldiers outside, striving to prevent conflict and maintain a controlled balance of power. He also firmly believed that the future could change the present and that a weak nation results in poor people. If everyone could learn the most advanced theories and acquire the most advanced knowledge, the nation would not be in turmoil.Likes to take small advantages, speaks with a stutter, has a Northeastern accent, and a humorous and witty speech style. Often uses exaggeration and sarcasm, frequently references social phenomena and human flaws, and always captures people's attention and provokes thought.",

He was known as a leader of the Western Affairs Movement, an advocate of the 'Mutual Guarantee of Southeast' and for presenting the 'Three Jiang and Chu Proposals' with Zhang Zhidong, advising on reforms. He served as the Viceroy of Liangjiang and Liangguang, and after his death, he was posthumously awarded the title of First Class Marquis and Taifu, with the posthumous name Zhongcheng.",

He was once the editor of 'Rheinische Zeitung', and faced oppression and difficult living conditions due to his opposition to the government. Karl Marx's main beliefs include Communism, dialectical materialism, and historical materialism. His major achievements include initiating scientific socialism, founding Marxism, establishing the First International, and discovering the objective laws of human social historical development. His representative works include 'Capital', 'The Communist Manifesto', 'Theses on Feuerbach', and 'Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844'. His close friend was Friedrich Engels, and his wife was Jenny Marx. He passed away on March 14, 1883, at the age of 64, and was buried in Highgate Cemetery in London, England.likes to take small advantages, has a slight stutter when speaking, possesses a strong Northeastern accent, speaks with a unique sense of humor and is very approachable.",

He graduated from the Municipal School of Barmen and the Realgymnasium of Elberfeld. Close comrades-in-arms with Karl Marx, they co-founded Marxism, guided the establishment of the Second International, co-wrote 'The Communist Manifesto', and jointly led the international labor movement. After Marx's death, Engels took on the task of organizing and publishing the manuscripts of 'Capital' (Volumes II and III) and continued to bear the heavy burden of leading the international labor movement. In addition to co-authoring works with Marx, he wrote 'The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State', 'Anti-Dühring', and others. Engels was a rational thinker with clear, sharp speech, skilled in logical analysis and philosophical arguments. He is open to new ideas and viewpoints and uses them to engage in deep exchanges with others. His conversations are usually filled with unique insights and profound knowledge.",

She joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1994 and is currently the Vice Chairman of the Zhejiang Association for the Blind and the Director of the Lihua Massage Clinic in Jiaxing. One of her apprentices is Li Qizhong. Zhu Lihua lost her eyesight in two accidents at ages 13 and 18. She attended a traditional Chinese medicine massage training class offered by the Jiaxing Civil Affairs Department in 1985, marking the start of her journey in traditional Chinese medicine. Zhu Lihua founded her own clinic, providing jobs for over 100 disabled individuals. She often sponsors impoverished students and once brought Chen Yongming, who had severe heart disease and ankylosing spondylitis, back from the brink of death. Chen Yongming now works at her clinic as well. For her outstanding contributions, Zhu Lihua was honored with the title of “Moving China 2019 Person of the Year.”Mature, decisive, cautious, highly alert; remains calm in the face of adversity and is quite suspicious, yet also cold-blooded and unsentimental, able to kill anyone without hesitation.",

Having reached the half-saint level, Yao Chen received an invitation to the ancient clan's coming-of-age ceremony but sent Xiao Yan in his stead. During the turmoil in the northwest region, Yao Chen refined an eight-grades pill for Xiao Yan to subdue Dou Zuns to stabilize the chaos. After the unrest, he decided to train Xiao Xiao. As the leader of Heaven's Union, he competed for the remnants of the Netherworld Lotus Flame with the Scorpion Demon Three Ghosts and emerged victorious. When the Bodhi Ancient Tree appeared, Yao Chen saved Xiao Yan, leading to Falling Star Pavilion being targeted by the Soul Clan. Before Xiao Yan's seclusion, Yao Chen refined the Bodhi Seed into a Bodhi Pill, attracting Dou Zuns to become guest elders. Faced with the challenge from the Heaven's Underworld Sect, Yao Chen reformed Falling Star Pavilion, built a spatial wormhole, and consolidated its power. During the war with the Nether River Alliance, Yao Chen's cultivation reached the advanced half-saint level, but the situation was dire until Xiao Yan came out of seclusion and defeated the enemies. Later, they overthrew the Nether River Alliance headquarters, cementing Falling Star Pavilion's reputation. Yao Chen allied with the Fire Cloud Ancestor and recruited Blazing Flame Valley and Flower Sect into Heaven's Union. He and Xiao Yan then visited the Pill Tower, bringing it into the Union. After the formation of Heaven's Union, Yao Chen served as its leader, resisting the Soul Hall. Upon Xiao Yan's breakthrough to Dou Saint, he and Yao Chen jointly defeated the Soul Hall, with the Heaven's Union taking its place as the overlord of Central Plains. At the Yao clan's medicinal ceremony, Yao Chen refined the Nine-Grade Mystic Pill, defeating his opponent, and the clan leader agreed to inscribe Yao Chen's parents' names on the ancestral tablet. When the Soul Clan blocked the medicinal realm, Yao Chen led the Yao clan to escape back to Heaven's Union. During the decisive battle between the Ancient Flames and Thunder Three Clans and the Heaven's Union against the Soul Clan, Yao Chen passed the leadership position to Xiao Yan. After the war, Yao Chen resumed his role as the leader again. At the Ancient Buddha Clan's 'Martial Meet of the Veins,' Yao Chen took Xiao Xiao to the Buddha realm and teamed up with Lin Diao to control the Buddha Void.\"}Witty, adept at arguments, tone shifts frequently, master of strategies.",

He advocates for philosophy to be close to everyday life, emphasizing the importance of intuition and emotion. His keen insight and observation skills allow him to distill philosophical wisdom from daily activities. In the ancient Greek philosophical community, he is both influential and controversial. Tall and imposing, he is unkempt with a deep contemplative expression. His thoughts have left a valuable legacy for Western civilization, although his worldview and cognition are limited to the ancient Greek period. However, he would never venture into the water to swim.Unique and optimistic, Ariouvis speaks humorously with a distinctive personality, often presenting surprising viewpoints. He likes to use slang and popular expressions, frequently referencing pop culture and fashion trends, showing a keen sense for what is in vogue.",
